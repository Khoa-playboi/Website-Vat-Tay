            <h1>Tricep Press Technique</h1>
            
            <div class="section-intro">
                <h2>The Pure Arm Strength Move</h2>
                <p>
                    The Tricep Press is the most direct and strength-focused technique in armwrestling. This move relies primarily on raw tricep muscle power to press your opponent's arm down and back. Unlike the finesse techniques like King's Move or the leverage-based moves like toproll, Tricep Press is all about pure, overwhelming arm strength.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tricep Press specialists are among the strongest armwrestlers, with incredibly developed tricep muscles that generate enormous pressing power. This technique is particularly effective when you have a strength advantage over your opponent.

                <h2>How to Execute the Perfect Tricep Press</h2>
                
                <h3>Step 1: Neutral Position</h3>
                <p>
                    Start with your hand on your opponent's hand, palm down, with a firm grip. Your arm is relatively straight, not curled. Your elbow is on the pad. Unlike hook techniques, you're not starting from a curled position. Your arm is ready to extend and press.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 2: Tricep Engagement</h3>
                <p>
                    Begin engaging your tricep muscles intensely. These large muscles on the back of your arm start contracting, preparing to extend your arm and press your opponent's arm backward and down. The movement starts from your triceps, not your forearm.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 3: Explosive Pressing Motion</h3>
                <p>
                    Execute an explosive pressing motion, using your triceps to press your opponent's arm down and back toward the pad. Your forearm extends, and your entire arm pushes with maximum power. This pressing action is more straightforward and less technical than other techniques—it's pure strength.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 4: Maintaining Pressure</h3>
                <p>
                    Continue pressing with maximum tricep power until your opponent's hand and arm are pinned to the pad. The key is maintaining crushing pressure throughout the pressing motion. Once you've initiated the press, don't release pressure until victory.

                <h2>Pro Tips for Tricep Press Mastery</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Massive Tricep Development:</strong> The Tricep Press requires enormous tricep muscle mass and strength. Make tricep development your primary training focus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pressing Motion Efficiency:</strong> Practice efficient pressing mechanics to maximize power transfer from your triceps to your opponent's arm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strength Advantage Leverage:</strong> Tricep Press is most effective when you have a strength advantage. Use this technique when you're significantly stronger.</li>
                    <li><strong>Explosive Start:</strong> Begin the press explosively to catch your opponent before they can establish their own technique.</li>
                    <li><strong>Continuous Pressure:</strong> Unlike hook which can succeed with a single curl, Tricep Press requires sustained pressing pressure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Body Mechanics:</strong> Use your body weight and leverage properly to assist your triceps. Your shoulder and body positioning matter.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section-intro">
                <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Insufficient Tricep Strength:</strong> If your triceps aren't strong enough, this technique won't work effectively. Build serious tricep strength first.</li>
                    <li><strong>Poor Pressing Mechanics:</strong> Using inefficient mechanics wastes your strength. Learn proper pressing form.</li>
                    <li><strong>Starting Position Issues:</strong> If you start in a weak position, you can't generate effective press. Position yourself properly before the match.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loss of Control:</strong> Pressing without control can lead to your arm being deflected. Maintain control throughout the press.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section-intro">
                <h2>Training Exercises for Tricep Press Dominance</h2>
                <p><strong>Close Grip Bench Press:</strong> Build raw pressing strength with heavy close grip bench pressing.</p>
                <p><strong>Tricep Dips:</strong> Perform weighted dips to build functional tricep pressing power.</p>
                <p><strong>Skull Crushers:</strong> Develop tricep strength with heavy skull crusher exercises.</p>
                <p><strong>Overhead Tricep Extensions:</strong> Build pressing-specific tricep strength with overhead movements.</p>
                <p><strong>Arm Wrestling Table Practice:</strong> Practice Tricep Press against partners to develop application and timing.</p>
