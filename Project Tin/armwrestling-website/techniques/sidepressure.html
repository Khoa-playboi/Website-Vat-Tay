            <h1>Side Pressure Technique</h1>
            
            <div class="section-intro">
                <h2>The Sideways Crushing Move</h2>
                <p>
                    Side Pressure is a brutal technique that applies crushing force sideways, rotating your opponent's arm and hand to the side until they surrender or their hand touches the pad. This move is devastating because it attacks from an unexpected angle and applies pressure that's difficult to defend against with traditional techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Side Pressure specialists are known for their ability to rotate and twist their opponent's arm with extreme power. This technique can cause significant pain in your opponent's hand, wrist, and forearm, making it a psychological weapon as well as a physical one.

                <h2>How to Execute Side Pressure</h2>
                
                <h3>Step 1: Initial Contact</h3>
                <p>
                    Begin with your hand positioned palm-down on your opponent's hand. Your grip is firm and secure. Your wrist is in a neutral position. Unlike the hook where you curl downward, in Side Pressure you're preparing to rotate and crush sideways.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 2: The Rotation</h3>
                <p>
                    Execute a powerful rotating movement, turning your hand and arm sideways. Your fingers and hand apply pressure that forces your opponent's hand to rotate in the same direction. This rotation is smooth but forceful, putting stress on your opponent's wrist and hand from an angle they might not be prepared to defend.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 3: Lateral Crushing Pressure</h3>
                <p>
                    As you rotate your hand sideways, apply maximum crushing pressure in that lateral direction. Your entire forearm and hand work together to compress your opponent's hand sideways. The pressure is relentless and causes significant stress and pain in your opponent's hand and wrist.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 4: The Victory</h3>
                <p>
                    Continue the rotation and pressure until either your opponent's hand rotates to touch the pad, or they surrender to the overwhelming pain and pressure. Side Pressure often wins through surrender rather than through pinning.
                </p>

                <h2>Pro Tips for Side Pressure Mastery</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wrist Rotation Strength:</strong> Build strength in your wrist rotators (pronators and supinators). This is the core of Side Pressure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hand Twisting Power:</strong> Your fingers and palm must be able to apply powerful twisting force. Build this with specific training.</li>
                    <li><strong>Expect Counter-Attacks:</strong> Side Pressure leaves you vulnerable to some counter-attacks, so maintain awareness and control.</li>
                    <li><strong>Angle Matters:</strong> The angle at which you apply side pressure is critical. Experiment to find the most effective angle against different opponents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pain Tolerance Advantage:</strong> Side Pressure works partially through pain. Your pain tolerance training gives you an advantage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quick Execution:</strong> Execute the side pressure rotation quickly before your opponent can defend against it.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section-intro">
                <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Slow Rotation:</strong> A slow side pressure rotation gives your opponent time to counter or defend. Make it explosive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grip Loosening:</strong> If you lose your grip during the rotation, your opponent can escape. Keep pressure consistent throughout.</li>
                    <li><strong>Telegraphing the Move:</strong> If your opponent sees the side pressure coming, they can defend. Make your preparation subtle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unbalanced Pressure:</strong> Ensure your pressure is applied evenly through your entire hand and forearm.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section-intro">
                <h2>Training Exercises for Side Pressure Power</h2>
                <p><strong>Wrist Rotations:</strong> Perform pronation and supination exercises with dumbbells or resistance bands to build rotational strength.</p>
                <p><strong>Hand Twisting Drills:</strong> Practice twisting movements with towels or resistance tools.</p>
                <p><strong>Grip Training:</strong> Build overall grip strength which supports all lateral crushing movements.</p>
                <p><strong>Forearm Rotation Curls:</strong> Combine wrist curls with rotation to build combined strength.</p>
                <p><strong>Table Specific Training:</strong> Practice side pressure against various opponents to develop timing and feel.</p>
