            <h1>King's Move Technique</h1>
            
            <div class="section-intro">
                <h2>The Pressure-Based Power Move</h2>
                <p>
                    King's Move is a sophisticated technique that relies on applying maximum pressure through your fingers and hand rather than using wrist curl or shoulder power. This move is all about control and applied pressure directly on your opponent's hand and fingers. It's called "King's Move" because executed properly, it's a regal, controlled demonstration of absolute dominance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This technique is particularly effective against hook and toproll specialists because it breaks their attacks through pure hand and finger pressure. It requires excellent hand strength and control.
                </p>

                <h2>How to Execute King's Move</h2>
                
                <h3>Step 1: Hand Positioning</h3>
                <p>
                    Start with your hand positioned for maximum pressure application. Your fingers are spread and positioned to apply pressure on the back of your opponent's hand and fingers. Your palm maintains contact while your fingers provide the crushing pressure. Your wrist is slightly extended but not locked.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 2: Building Pressure</h3>
                <p>
                    Begin applying intense pressure through your fingers, specifically pushing down and back on your opponent's hand. This pressure is applied directly through your fingers crushing down. The key is distributing pressure across multiple points on your opponent's hand rather than focusing on one area.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 3: Hand Dominance</h3>
                <p>
                    As you apply finger pressure, your entire hand works together to control your opponent's hand position. You're forcing their hand backward and controlling their fingers. This prevents them from executing their own technique and leaves them purely defensive.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 4: Maintaining Control</h3>
                <p>
                    King's Move is about control and maintaining it throughout the match. The pressure might not be as explosive as a hook or toproll, but it's relentless and grinding. Continue applying maximum hand and finger pressure until your opponent's hand is pinned or they surrender to the pressure.
                </p>

                <h2>Pro Tips for King's Move Mastery</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hand Strength Priority:</strong> King's Move is entirely about hand and finger strength. Dedicate significant training to building crushing hand power.</li>
                    <li><strong>Finger Pressure Application:</strong> Learn to apply pressure specifically through your fingers in multiple directions simultaneously.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hand Flexibility:</strong> Flexible hand and wrist positioning allows you to adjust pressure angles during the match.</li>
                    <li><strong>Defensive Strength:</strong> King's Move is excellent for defense. Use it to stop opponent attacks and turn them into control positions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistent Pressure:</strong> Unlike explosive moves, King's Move requires steady, relentless pressure throughout the match.</li>

                <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Uneven Pressure:</strong> Applying pressure unevenly allows your opponent to escape. Distribute pressure across multiple points.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weak Finger Application:</strong> If your fingers aren't strong enough, King's Move won't work. Build finger strength first.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loss of Hand Control:</strong> If your hand positioning weakens, your opponent can attack. Maintain hand dominance throughout.</li>
                    <li><strong>Patience Loss:</strong> King's Move is a grinding technique. Don't get impatient waiting for the finish.</li>
                </ul>
