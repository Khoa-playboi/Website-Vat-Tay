                <h2>Long-Term Power Development</h2>
                <p>
                    Building armwrestling strength isn't a sprint—it's a marathon. To become truly dominant at the armwrestling table, you need a comprehensive, long-term strength development strategy. Below are the essential principles and tips that professional armwrestlers use to build crushing, competition-winning strength.

                <h2>Progressive Overload Principle</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Increase Weight Gradually:</strong> Each week, try to increase the weight you're lifting by 2-5 pounds. Small incremental increases drive continuous strength growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Increase Repetitions:</strong> When you can't increase weight, increase the number of repetitions. Going from 8 to 10 reps is progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Increase Sets:</strong> Add an additional set to your exercises to increase total volume and strength stimulus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Decrease Rest Periods:</strong> Reducing rest between sets while maintaining weight increases intensity and strength development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Improve Exercise Form:</strong> Sometimes just improving your form and generating more tension from the same weight drives strength gains.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h2>Nutrition for Maximum Strength</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Protein Intake:</strong> Consume 1-1.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight daily. Protein is the building block for muscle growth and recovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Caloric Surplus:</strong> To build muscle and strength, you need to consume more calories than you burn. Aim for a 300-500 calorie daily surplus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Carbohydrates for Energy:</strong> Carbs fuel your workouts and recovery. Don't cut carbs when training hard for armwrestling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Healthy Fats:</strong> Include healthy fats from fish, nuts, and seeds. These support hormone production and overall health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Hydration:</strong> Drink at least 1 gallon of water daily, more if you're training intensely. Hydration supports muscle growth and strength.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h2>Recovery & Rest Strategies</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sleep Priority:</strong> Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep every night. Muscle growth and strength development happen during sleep, not in the gym.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Rest Days:</strong> Take at least one full rest day per week. Overtraining leads to injury and plateau, not progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Active Recovery:</strong> On rest days, perform light activity like walking or stretching to maintain mobility without stressing muscles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ice Baths & Stretching:</strong> After intense training sessions, use ice baths or cold water immersion to reduce inflammation and support recovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Massage & Mobility Work:</strong> Regular massage and mobility work prevent injury and improve recovery quality.
                </p>

                <h2>Avoiding Common Strength Mistakes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Not Tracking Progress:</strong> Keep a training log of all your exercises, weights, and reps. You can't improve what you don't measure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Poor Exercise Selection:</strong> Focus on compound, armwrestling-specific movements. Don't waste time on isolation exercises that don't transfer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inconsistent Training:</strong> Missing workouts kills progress. Make training a non-negotiable part of your schedule.</li>
                    <li><strong>Neglecting Weak Points:</strong> If one muscle group is weak, your overall strength is limited. Address weaknesses directly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ego Lifting:</strong> Using weight that's too heavy with poor form doesn't build strength—it causes injuries. Use controlled, perfect form.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not Training Specifically:</strong> General strength work is good, but armwrestling-specific training is crucial. Spend significant time at the table.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section-intro">
                <h2>12-Week Strength Building Cycle</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Weeks 1-4 (Hypertrophy Phase):</strong> Focus on building muscle mass with 8-12 reps per set and moderate weight. Higher volume, shorter rest periods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Weeks 5-8 (Strength Phase):</strong> Shift to heavier weight with lower reps (3-5 reps) to build maximum strength. Lower volume, longer rest periods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Weeks 9-12 (Power Phase):</strong> Focus on explosive movements and sport-specific training. Lower weight but explosive execution. High specificity to armwrestling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After 12 weeks, repeat the cycle with slightly heavier weight. Over a full year, this builds dramatic strength gains.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section-intro">
                <h2>Mental Strength Development</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Visualize yourself winning matches and executing techniques perfectly. Mental rehearsal builds confidence and performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Goal Setting:</strong> Set specific, measurable strength goals (e.g., "5 lbs stronger grip in 3 months"). Clear goals drive focused training.</li>
                    <li><strong>Positive Self-Talk:</strong> Before matches, tell yourself you're strong, prepared, and ready to dominate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Competition Mindset:</strong> Train with competitive intensity. Match simulation is the best mental training.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> You'll hit plateaus and have bad training days. Stay committed through the difficult periods.</li>
