                <h2>The Foundation of Fair Competition</h2>
                <p>
                    Basic rules form the foundation of all armwrestling competitions. These rules ensure fair play, prevent injuries, and create a standardized competition format. Every competitor must understand and follow these basic rules to be allowed to compete.
                </p>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h2>Official Grip Requirements</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Palm-to-Palm Contact:</strong> Your hand must be palm-down on your opponent's hand with palm-to-palm contact. Fingers can be gripped, but the palm must make contact with the opponent's palm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Thumb Position:</strong> Your thumb must not be placed on top of your opponent's hand. It must wrap around their hand with your other fingers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Finger Placement:</strong> Your fingers wrap firmly around your opponent's hand. No fingers can be placed on the back of the opponent's hand—they must wrap around the palm side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>No Slipping:</strong> Once the match begins, your hand position is locked. You cannot adjust your grip once action starts.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h2>Hand and Arm Positioning</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Elbow on Pad:</strong> Your elbow must remain on the armwrestling pad throughout the match. Lifting your elbow results in immediate loss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Shoulder Position:</strong> Your shoulder must be positioned at a 90-degree angle to the table. You cannot lean forward or backward excessively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Upper Arm Contact:</strong> Your upper arm above the elbow should make contact with the pad. The entire arm must remain on the pad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Body Position:</strong> You must be seated or standing properly at the table. You cannot use your body weight to lean into the match excessively.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h2>Legal Moves & Actions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hook Technique:</strong> Curling your wrist and forearm downward is legal as long as your elbow stays on the pad.</li>
                    <li><strong>Toproll Technique:</strong> Rolling your arm over your opponent's arm is legal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Side Pressure:</strong> Applying lateral pressure is legal as long as you maintain proper positioning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pressure Techniques:</strong> Applying maximum hand and finger pressure is legal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Arm Rotation:</strong> Rotating your arm and hand is legal in most positions.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h2>Common Fouls & Penalties</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Elbow Off Pad:</strong> If your elbow leaves the pad, you lose immediately. This is the most common foul.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grip Break:</strong> Breaking your grip during the match results in a foul and loss.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shoulder Foul:</strong> Improper shoulder positioning can result in a warning or penalty.</li>
                    <li><strong>False Start:</strong> Moving before the referee signals "go" results in a false start warning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wrist Grip Foul:</strong> Certain wrist positions can be considered illegal depending on the federation.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section-intro">
                <h2>Winning Conditions</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Pin to Pad:</strong> The primary way to win is to pin your opponent's hand to the pad. Once their hand touches the pad, the match is over and you win.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Opponent Submission:</strong> If your opponent submits or signals that they surrender, you win immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Opponent Foul:</strong> If your opponent commits a foul such as lifting their elbow, you win by foul.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Time Limit:</strong> If neither competitor achieves a pin within the time limit, the match is judged by judges based on positioning and control.
                </p>
