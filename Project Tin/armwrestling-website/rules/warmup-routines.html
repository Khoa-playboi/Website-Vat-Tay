                <h2>Prepare Your Body for Battle</h2>
                <p>
                    A proper warm-up routine is essential before any armwrestling competition or intense training session. Warm-ups increase blood flow, elevate body temperature, prepare your nervous system, and reduce injury risk. Professional armwrestlers never skip warm-ups—they know that a good warm-up can be the difference between victory and injury.

                    <strong>Light Cardio:</strong> Start with 2-3 minutes of light cardio (jumping jacks, jogging in place, or light running). This increases heart rate and body temperature without fatiguing your muscles.

                    <strong>Arm Circles:</strong> Perform arm circles in both directions, starting small and gradually increasing the range of motion. 10 circles each direction, 2 sets.

                    <strong>Shoulder Rolls:</strong> Roll your shoulders forward and backward in controlled motions. 10 reps each direction.

                <p>
                    <strong>Wrist Rotations:</strong> Rotate your wrists in circles, building mobility and blood flow. 10 rotations each direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Neck Stretches:</strong> Gently stretch your neck in all directions—forward, backward, and to each side. Hold each position for 15 seconds.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique-box">

                    <strong>Tricep Stretch:</strong> Bring your elbow behind your head and gently pull with the other arm. Hold 15 seconds, 2 reps per arm.

                <p>
                    <strong>Chest Stretch:</strong> Clasp your hands behind your back and lift your chest, stretching your pectorals. Hold 20 seconds.
                </p>

                    <strong>Match Simulation (Light):</strong> If possible, perform a light practice match against an opponent at 50% intensity. This is the best specific warm-up.

                <h2>Injury Prevention During Warm-Up</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Never Skip Warm-Up:</strong> Even if you're short on time, a 10-minute minimum warm-up is non-negotiable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gradual Intensity Increase:</strong> Always start light and gradually increase intensity. Never go full intensity cold.</li>
                    <li><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> If you feel pain (not normal muscle sensation), stop immediately.</li>
                    <li><strong>Joint Mobility First:</strong> Always prioritize joint mobility work before heavy muscle work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Stay hydrated throughout your warm-up. Drink water before, during, and after.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Use the same warm-up routine before every session and competition for consistency and habit formation.</li>
