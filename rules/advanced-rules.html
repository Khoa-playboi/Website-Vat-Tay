                <h2>Complex Scenarios & Pro-Level Competition</h2>
                <p>
                    As you progress in armwrestling, you'll encounter more complex rule interpretations and referee decisions. Advanced rules cover edge cases, controversial scenarios, and professional-level standards. Understanding these rules will help you compete effectively at the highest levels of competition.

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h2>Controversial Scenarios</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Simultaneous Pin:</strong> If both competitors' hands touch the pad simultaneously, the referee must determine who truly pinned first. Slow-motion replay is often used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Partial Hand Contact:</strong> If your opponent's hand is partially off the pad, it may not count as a full pin depending on the federation's interpretation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Disputed Elbow Position:</strong> If it's unclear whether an elbow truly left the pad, the referee watches for clear separation from the pad surface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Table Edge Contacts:</strong> If your opponent's hand reaches the edge of the table, the referee must determine if it counts as a pin to the pad.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h2>Judging Criteria for Time Limits</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Control Position:</strong> Which competitor maintained better control throughout the match?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Dominant Technique:</strong> Who demonstrated their technique more effectively?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Hand Position:</strong> Whose hand is in a more dominant position at the end of the time limit?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Pressure Application:</strong> Who applied more consistent and dominant pressure throughout the match?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Opponent Fatigue:</strong> Which competitor appeared stronger and less fatigued?
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h2>Federation-Specific Rules</h2>
                <p>
                    Different armwrestling federations (WAL, ARM, EJF, etc.) may have slight variations in rules:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Grip Position Variations:</strong> Some federations allow slight differences in thumb positioning or finger placement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wrist Lock Rules:</strong> Some federations restrict certain wrist locks, while others allow them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Starting Position:</strong> Some federations use different starting positions than others.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Limits:</strong> Different federations set different time limits for matches (60 seconds, 120 seconds, etc.).</li>
                    <li><strong>Weight Classes:</strong> Most professional competitions use weight classes to ensure fair matchups.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h2>Referee Hand Signals</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>"GO":</strong> The referee indicates the match has started. Both competitors may begin immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Foul Signal:</strong> The referee signals a foul by the offending competitor (usually pointing).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Thumb Down:</strong> Indicates a pin—the competitor whose hand was pinned loses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Timeout Signal:</strong> The referee calls for a time stoppage, usually for injury or foul assessment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Draw/No Winner:</strong> If no winner is determined by pin, the referee signals the match is going to judges.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section-intro">
