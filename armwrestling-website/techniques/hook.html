            <h1>The Hook Technique</h1>
            
            <div class="section-intro">
                <h2>The Most Powerful Move in Armwrestling</h2>
                <p>
                    The hook is the most popular and devastating technique in competitive armwrestling. This move involves curling your arm and wrist downward while applying maximum pressure with your hand and forearm. When executed correctly, a powerful hook can pin even the strongest opponent to the pad in seconds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Legends like Devon Larratt built their entire careers on perfecting the hook. It's the technique that combines strength, technique, and raw dominance all in one brutal movement.

                <h2>How to Execute the Perfect Hook</h2>
                
                <h3>Step 1: Initial Position</h3>
                <p>
                    Start with your hand palm-down on your opponent's hand. Your fingers should be wrapped firmly, creating a vice-like grip. Your wrist is in a neutral position, not yet curled. The key is maintaining complete control from the start of the match.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 2: The Curl</h3>
                <p>
                    Begin curling your wrist downward in a powerful motion. Your forearm muscles engage, and your hand pulls your opponent's arm toward you. This curl is the defining movement of the hook—it's where the power comes from. Think of it as hammering your opponent's arm down to the pad.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 3: Applying Pressure</h3>
                <p>
                    As you curl your wrist, simultaneously apply pressure by contracting your forearm and hand muscles. Your elbow stays firmly on the pad, providing stability and leverage. The pressure builds up, making it impossible for your opponent to escape the curling motion.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 4: The Pin</h3>
                <p>
                    Continue the curl and pressure until your opponent's hand and arm are pinned to the pad. At this point, you've won the match. The entire execution should be smooth, explosive, and devastating.
                </p>

                <h2>Pro Tips for Mastering the Hook</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Grip Strength First:</strong> Build your grip strength with dedicated training. Your grip determines how much pressure you can apply through the curl.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wrist Flexibility:</strong> A flexible wrist allows for a more aggressive curl. Perform wrist flexibility exercises daily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Forearm Endurance:</strong> Hook matches can be intense. Build forearm endurance so you don't fatigue during the curl.</li>
                    <li><strong>Explosive Start:</strong> Begin with an explosive movement at the start of the match. Many hooks are won in the first second.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feel Your Opponent:</strong> Pay attention to how your opponent's arm responds. Adjust your pressure and curl angle accordingly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lower Hand Position:</strong> Keeping your hand slightly lower on the table gives you better leverage for the curl.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section-intro">
                <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Slow Curl:</strong> A slow hook is easy to defend against. Always execute with explosive speed and power.</li>
                    <li><strong>Releasing Grip:</strong> If you lose your grip during the curl, you lose control. Keep your grip tight throughout.</li>
                    <li><strong>Elbow Off the Pad:</strong> Lifting your elbow weakens the hook significantly. Keep it glued to the pad.</li>
                    <li><strong>Poor Starting Position:</strong> If you don't start with complete control, you won't hook successfully. Always establish dominance from the grip.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section-intro">
                <h2>Training Exercises for Hook Mastery</h2>
                <p><strong>Wrist Curls:</strong> With a dumbbell or barbell, perform controlled wrist curls to build the pulling muscles used in the hook.</p>
                <p><strong>Crush Grip Training:</strong> Use grip trainers or hand squeeze devices to build maximum grip strength.</p>
                <p><strong>Reverse Barbell Curls:</strong> Build forearm strength with heavy reverse curls.</p>
                <p><strong>Armwrestling Table Practice:</strong> Practice actual hook matches on a table with training partners to develop feel and timing.</p>
                <p><strong>Wrist Flexibility Stretches:</strong> Perform daily stretching to improve wrist mobility and prevent injury.</p>
